- **[troubleshooting.md](guides/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

### `/examples/` - Usage Examples

- **[workflows.md](examples/workflows.md)** - Powerful agentic workflows and use cases
- **[kare.txt](examples/kare.txt)** - Real example of creating an icon pack with fal-mcp

### `/architecture/` - Technical Architecture

- **[dynamic-models.md](architecture/dynamic-models.md)** - Dynamic model discovery system design and philosophy

### `/development/` - Development Resources

- **[local-testing.md](development/local-testing.md)** - Local development and testing
- **[deployment.md](development/deployment.md)** - Deployment options and configuration
- **[publishing.md](development/publishing.md)** - Publishing to npm

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Start with [guides/setup.md](guides/setup.md) for installation
2. **Examples**: Check [examples/workflows.md](examples/workflows.md) for use cases
3. **Troubleshooting**: If you run into issues, see [guides/troubleshooting.md](guides/troubleshooting.md)

## üéØ Key Features

- **Dynamic Model Discovery**: Use any model from fal.ai without hardcoded lists
- **Local Image Support**: Process images directly from your filesystem
- **Workflow Chains**: Combine multiple operations for complex tasks
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files efficiently

## üìö Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows the same principles as our dynamic model system:

- **User-Focused**: Organized by what you want to accomplish
- **Comprehensive**: From beginner setup to advanced workflows
- **Maintainable**: Clear structure that scales with the project
- **Example-Driven**: Real examples show the power of the tools

## üîÑ Recent Reorganization

We've consolidated and reorganized the documentation structure:

- **Merged 3 dynamic models docs** into one comprehensive architecture guide
- **Created logical subdirectories** for different types of documentation
- **Improved discoverability** with clear naming and structure
- **Added real examples** from actual usage sessions

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new documentation:

- Use the appropriate subdirectory (`/guides/`, `/examples/`, `/architecture/`, `/development/`)
- Follow the existing markdown formatting conventions
- Include practical examples where possible
- Update this README if adding new major sections
