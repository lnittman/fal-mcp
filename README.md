# fal-mcp

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for fal.ai that enables natural language image generation and processing through Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

## Features

### Image Tools
- üé® **Text to Image**: Generate images from text prompts using FLUX models
- üñºÔ∏è **Image to Image**: Transform images with natural language (e.g., "convert to pixel art")
- üìÅ **Batch Processing**: Apply transformations to entire folders
- üíæ **Save & Resize**: Save images locally with optional resizing and format conversion

### Video Tools
- üé¨ **Text to Video**: Create videos from text descriptions
- üé• **Image to Video**: Animate static images with motion

### Audio Tools
- üéôÔ∏è **Text to Speech**: Convert text to natural speech with multiple voices
- üìù **Speech to Text**: Transcribe audio with language detection

### Infrastructure
- üåê **Dual Transport**: Works via HTTP (deployed) or STDIO (local file access)
- üîó **Agentic Ready**: Tools designed for natural language chaining

## Installation

### Quick Install with Claude Desktop

```bash
claude mcp add fal -- npx -y @fal-ai/mcp
```

Then add your API key to the Claude configuration.

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fal-mcp.git
cd fal-mcp

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up your fal.ai API key
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your key from https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys

# Build and test
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

## Usage

### Development Mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start        # HTTP server
pnpm start-stdio  # STDIO mode
```

### Configure in Claude Desktop

See [Setup Guide](./docs/guides/setup.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

Quick config for `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fal-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/fal-mcp/stdio-wrapper.js"],
      "env": {
        "FAL_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### textToImage
Generate images from text descriptions.

Example prompts:
- "Generate a pixel art cat"
- "Create a watercolor landscape of mountains"
- "Make an 8-bit style robot"

### imageToImage
Transform existing images using natural language. Supports both URLs and local file paths.

Example prompts:
- "Convert this to pixel art" (with URL: https://example.com/image.jpg)
- "Transform /Users/me/Desktop/photo.jpg to vintage style" (with local file)
- "Make it look like a watercolor painting"
- "Add neon glow effects"

### batchProcessImages
Process all images in a folder with the same transformation.

Example: "Convert all images in ~/Pictures to pixel art style"

### saveImage
Save images from URLs to local files with optional resizing.

Example: "Save this image as a 32x32 favicon"

## Example Workflows

### Generate and Set Favicon
1. "Generate a pixel art logo of a rocket"
2. "Save that image as ~/Desktop/favicon.ico with favicon sizes"

### Batch Style Transfer
1. "Convert all images in ~/vacation-photos to watercolor style"

### Create and Transform
1. "Generate a photo of a cat"
2. "Transform it to look like an oil painting"
3. "Save it to ~/Desktop/cat-painting.png"

## Environment Variables

- `FAL_API_KEY`: Your fal.ai API key (required)

## Known Issues

- **Image Display in Claude Desktop**: Currently, Claude Desktop may show "Unsupported image type: undefined" errors even though images are generated successfully. As a workaround, the image URL is included in the text response. See [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details.

## Development

The project uses:
- [xmcp](https://xmcp.dev) - MCP server framework
- [@fal-ai/serverless-client](https://fal.ai/docs) - fal.ai SDK
