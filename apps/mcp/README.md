### Configure in Claude Desktop

See [Setup Guide](./docs/guides/setup.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

Quick config for `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fal-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/fal-mcp/stdio-wrapper.js"],
      "env": {
        "FAL_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### textToImage
Generate images from text descriptions.

Example prompts:
- "Generate a pixel art cat"

### batchProcessImages
Process all images in a folder with the same transformation.

Example: "Convert all images in ~/Pictures to pixel art style"

### saveImage
Save images from URLs to local files with optional resizing.

Example: "Save this image as a 32x32 favicon"

## Example Workflows

### Generate and Set Favicon
1. "Generate a pixel art logo of a rocket"
