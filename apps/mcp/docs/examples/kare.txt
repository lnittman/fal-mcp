   in there to understand the aesthetic and philosophical direction.

⏺ Task(Task: Explore inspo directory

      Prompt: Search and read files in the docs/inspo directory to understand the aesthetic, philosophical,
      and design inspirations that should inform the icon pack design. Look for key themes, principles, and
      visual references.)

⏺ Perfect! I've created a pixel art icon pack inspired by Susan Kare's pioneering work and the design
  philosophies from your inspo docs. The collection includes:

  Individual Icons Created:
  - Home - Classic house shape
  - Folder - Manila folder with tab
  - Document - Paper with folded corner
  - Trash - Friendly waste basket
  - Save - Nostalgic floppy disk
  - Settings - Gear/cog wheel
  - Search - Magnifying glass
  - Mail - Envelope
  - User - Profile silhouette
  - Heart - Love/favorite
  - Star - Bookmark/rating
  - Download - Arrow into box
  - Camera - Simple camera body

  All icons follow the core principles:
  - Pure black pixels on white (1-bit style)
  - 32x32 pixel grid constraint
  - 2-pixel stroke consistency
  - Geometric clarity with slight personality
  - Universal recognition across cultures
  - Nostalgic yet timeless design

  The icons embody Susan Kare's philosophy of making technology approachable through familiar metaphors and
  constraint-driven creativity.
